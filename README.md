# Highell_Cls

provide tools to compute high multipole (small-scale) angular power spectra of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects. Examples of how to obtain such spectra are given in the tutorial notebook.

## tSZ angular power spectra

The tSZ Cls are computed with a Random Forest network (see Douspis et al. 2022).

* Highell_Cls.Cl_tsz_fromRF(dictionary) returns ell, Cls between l=2, l=13500 with Cls in muK2 at 143GHz. The dictionary contains cosmological and scaling relation parameters such as: C_SR_params={"bias": 0.8,
                        "H0": 64,
                        "omb": 0.05,
                        "om": 0.31,
                        "sig8": 0.8,
                        "alpha":1.77})

* Highell_Cls.Cl_tsz_fromRF(dictionary) uses two input files corresponding to the coefficients of the Random Forest (RF-TSZ-2021-3__clf_rf_params.pickle) and the exponents of the parameters dependency (tRF-TSZ-2021-4__exponents.pickle) stored in tszcl_coeff/ If the RF-params is not already in your directory (first timetry) t will be downloaded. 

## kSZ angular power spectra

The late-time and patchy kSZ Cls are computed independently with a Random Forest network, given a set of cosmological and reionisation parameters(see Gorce et al. 2022 for more details).

* Highell_Cls.Cl_ksz_fromRF(dictionary) returns the ell-bins the RF was trained on (between l=2, l=13500), the late-time kSZ, and the patchy kSZ Cls in muK2. The dictionary contains cosmological and sreionisation parameters such as: 
param_dict={"omegabh2": 0.0224,
            "omegach2": 0.120,
            "ns": 0.9665,
            "theta": 1.041,
            "logA": 3.044,
            "zre": 7.5,
            "dz": 1.2,
            "logalpha0": 3.7,
            "kappa": 0.10}
